Hi my name is Steve Tompson and I'm a researcher and data analyst.
I've also been a Michigan Wolverines fan since I moved to Ann Arbor and started working as a researcher at UofM in 2009.
My first game at the Big House, Denard Robinson fumbled on his first snap, picked the ball up, and ran the ball 43 yards for a TD.
My second game at the Big House, Michigan scored with 11 seconds left to beat Notre Dame.
Just two years later they completed an even more improbable comeback, 
scoring 28 points in the 4th quarter, including a 3-play 80-yard drive in the final 30 seconds to clinch the victory.
There have been a few decent years in between, but it's pretty safe to say that Michigan football's recent history has been disappointing.

Michigan is 2-6 against their rivals (Michigan State and Ohio State), 6-8 in games decided by one score or less, 8-11 against top 25 opponents, 1-9 against top 10 opponents,
X-X against teams who finished the season with a top-10 offense, and X-X against teams who finished the season with a top-10 defense.

On the positive side, Michigan is 38-9 against non-rivals and 39-7 against teams outside the top-10. 
It's safe to say that Michigan is a top-25 team, but is struggling to compete against the upper echelon of college football. 
So what is holding Michigan back? 

There have been a number of explanations posited over the past few years: 

1. Michigan is undisciplined and poorly coached, 
2. The offensive system is too complicated for college players, 
3. The offensive system is too slow, antiquated, and poorly suited for competing against good teams
4. The team is at a talent disadvantage relative to other top-10 teams
5. Teams have figured out Don Brown's defense
6. The offense lacks identity

These all have some merit and I might tackle the discipline and defense issues in future posts, but for now I would like to focus on the offense. 
The offense is clearly the most disappointing part of the team (see stats below), and so even if those other issues are contributing to the team's struggles to be a top-10 team, 
figuring out how to fix the offense would go a long way towards making this team competitive against elite opponents.

There are a few interesting take-aways from a quick examination of Michigan's play-calling data.
-First, they need to get the ball to their playmakers more frequently
    -Charbonnet, Turner, Collins, Black, DPJ, Bell, and McKeon are averaging X yards/play with a X% success rate
    -All other RB/WR/TE are averaging X yards/play with a X% success rate
    -X% of touches go to these 7 players
    -You have 7 solid weapons on this team. No offense to Eubanks, Wilson, Giles Jackson, etc., but they just don't need to be getting X% of the non-garbage time touches
-Second, the running game is sorely lacking big plays, in part due to an imbalance in # of box defenders
    -on an average run play, Michigan has X WRs and the defense has X defenders in the box
-2A and 2B:
    -they need to develop a solid 2nd running play to balance their reliance on the inside zone
    -they need to establish the QB run to spread out the defense and remove the box defender advantage
-Third, the passing game needs more fades 
-Fourth, the passing game needs to work on the timing for screens and slants
    -completion rate for screens and slants by opponents is X%, whereas completion rate for Michigan is X%

In particular, Michigan's offense has continually let the team down: 

1. Michigan is 3-13 when the opposing team scores 24 or more points, and
2. Michigan's offense has scored 19 points/game when playing a top-10 opponent and 25 points/game when playing a top-25 opponent (compared to 37 points/game against unranked opponents)

In this first blog post, I will walk through how to scrape play-by-play data for Michigan games from the web and import it into a pandas dataframe. 
Then, I will walk through some basic data mining approaches to identify trends in Michigan's play-calling.



Blog #2: How does Michigan's play-calling compare to their opponents (especially the ones with good offenses)

So what is holding 

6-8 in games decided by one score or less, 9-8 in games separated by one score entering the 4th quarter, 8-11 against top 25 opponents, 1-9 against top 10 opponents, 
X-X against teams who finished the season with a top-10 offense, and X-X against teams who finished the season with a top-10 defense.
-Michigan is 17-10 in close games entering the 4th quarter, but that is mostly because they are 8-0 in games where they had at least an 8 point lead entering the 4th quarter

There are a few interesting take-aways from a quick examination of Michigan's play-calling data.
-First, they need to get the ball to their playmakers more frequently
    -Charbonnet, Turner, Collins, Black, DPJ, Bell, and McKeon are averaging X yards/play with a X% success rate
    -All other RB/WR/TE are averaging X yards/play with a X% success rate
    -X% of touches go to these 7 players
    -By contrast, X% of touches/targets went to the top 7 players on top-5 offenses in 2018
    -You have 7 solid weapons on this team. No offense to Eubanks, Wilson, Giles Jackson, etc., but they just don't need to be getting X% of the non-garbage time touches
-Second, the running game is sorely lacking big plays, in part due to an imbalance in # of box defenders

    -completion rate for screens and slants by opponents is X%, whereas completion rate for Michigan is X%


2. Michigan's offense has scored multiple TDs ONCE in 8 games where they were losing by 7 points or less entering the 4th quarter (somehow Michigan is 3-5 in those games).
3. Michigan's offense has scored multiple TDs 3 times in 27 competitive games entering the 4th quarter (also, fewer than half of all Michigan games have been competitive in the past 5 years
