    <h1>Data and Human Behavior</h1>
    <p></p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/data_science.png" width="200" align="right">
    <p>How can data help us better understand human behavior? What insights can we derive about why people behave in certain ways,
    and what can we learn that will improve decision-making in the future? In this blog, I will use Python and R to scrape web data 
    about human behavior in a variety of domains (sports, politics, music, movies) and use stats to identify important behavioral patterns and 
    make recommendations for how this behavior could be "better". This blog is a side-project and I hope to post weekly, 
    but articles might be more sporadic at times.</p>
