    <h1>Analyzing Human Behavior in the Information Age</h1>
    <p></p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/data_science.png" width="360" align="right">
    <p>How can data help us better understand human behavior? What insights can we derive about why people behave in certain ways,
    and what can we learn that will improve decision-making in the future? 
    If you know where to look and how to access it, there is there is practically an infinite amount of data on how humans behave in any topic or domain.
    In this blog, I will use Python and R to scrape web data about human behavior in a variety of domains (sports, politics, music, movies) 
    and use stats to identify important behavioral patterns and 
    make recommendations for how this behavior could be "better". This blog is a side-project and I hope to post weekly, 
    but articles might be more sporadic at times.</p>
