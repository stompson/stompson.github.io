What in the world is going on with the Michigan Wolverines? 
Jim Harbaugh was supposed to be the savior of Ann Arbor. 
The man who would finally bring Michigan back to its glory days, its rightful place on top of the Big Ten, and a National Championship.
But these days, many people are having a hard time imagining Michigan even winning its division, much less the Big Ten or a National Championship.

I'm a researcher and data analyst, and so I thought we might be able to derive some insights into the Michigan Wolverines' struggles using data analytics.

First, defining the problem:

Michigan is actually quite good against decent opponents. They're 7-3 and have outscored teams ranked 10-25 by an average score of 31-14. 
They've had a top-10 recruiting class three of the past four years and a top-10 defense four years in a row. 
But, their elite defense and elite talent have not been nearly good enough when it comes to playing other elite teams. 
Instead, Michigan is 1-9 against top-10 opponents, has been outscored 34 to 19 on average, and has only scored 30+ points once.

Clearly when you're being outscored 34 to 19 there are issues that need to be fixed on both offense and defense, 
but I am going to test the hypothesis that, contrary to the old adage that "Defense wins championships", 
an elite offense is crucial to winning games against elite opponents.

To do this, I am using data from the CFBdata API which contains S&P+ team ratings as well as game outcomes for each team.
Here I am going to test the hypothesis 

-How do teams' offenses and defenses perform against elite opponents RELATIVE to their average output? 
-OR relative to how many points they would be expected to score (or allow) against an average defense (or offfense)?
-Does this differ depending on whether that specific unit is also elite (i.e., do elite offenses experience less of a letdown in big games?)

Once we've established that having an elite offense is important for winning big games against elite opponents, 
what is ailing Michigan's offense, and what can Michigan do to improve?
