    <p>Ever read an academic paper, or see a report or article online reporting some results or pretty figures, and wonder 
    how did they do that? This page is my way to help others see, reproduce, and replicate the analytics that I've done in my 
    academic papers and blog. The links below will take you to the paper or blog post as well as the Github repository 
    with the data and code to run the analyses I report in the paper or blog post.</p>
