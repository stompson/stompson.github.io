    <p></p>
    <p>I received my PhD in Social Psychology from the University of Michigan in 2016. 
    I worked as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and 
    U.S. Army Research Laboratory from 2016-2019. I am currently a Behavioral Data Scientist at Guild Education, 
    where I use data to help improve education access and outcomes for individuals from underserved populations. </p>

    <p>I am a stats nerd and am passionate about using data to answer burning questions about how and why people do the things they do. 
    Whether this is understanding cultural differences in decision-making, 
    identifying patterns in human social interaction that predict team performance, or
    figuring out why Michigan football's offense is so disappointing (see my <a href="https://stompson.github.io/blog">blog</a>),
    I love using data to derive insights about human behavior. </p>
