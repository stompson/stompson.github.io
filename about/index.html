			<p></p>
			<p>I received my PhD in Social Psychology from the University of Michigan in 2016. 
			Since then, I have been working as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and 
			U.S. Army Research Laboratory. I am currently the Robert J. Eichelberger Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow 
			in the Human Sciences Campaign at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory 
			and a Visiting Scholar in the Bioengineering Department at the University of Pennsylvania. </p>

			<p>I am a stats nerd and am passionate about using data to answer burning questions about how and why people do the things they do. 
			Whether this is understanding cultural differences in decision-making, 
			identifying patterns in human social interaction that predict team performance, or
			figuring out why Michigan football's offense is so disappointing (see my <a href="https://stompson.github.io/blog">blog</a>),
			I love using data to derive insights about human behavior. </p>
